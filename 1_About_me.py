## Hi, I’m Indera Ihsan


I work as a **Data Scientist at KJPP RHR**, where we’re building machine learning models to help understand property values more intelligently and intuitively.

This app is part of my journey — a space to share not just models and projects, but also bits of my hobbies: **gaming, photography**, and the occasional quiet reflection.

Thanks for stopping by. Feel free to explore and reach out if anything here speaks to you.
